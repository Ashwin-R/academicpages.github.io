I'm a 3nd year PhD student at the University of Michigan School of Information. My research is broadly on computational social science and social computing. I am intrigued by how real world factors such as social and cultural biases shape the online space. I use large scale data analysis and machine learning on online behavioral data to better understand how we behave and operate both online and offline. I'm advised by [Ceren Budak](http://cbudak.com/index.html) and [Paul Resnick](http://presnick.people.si.umich.edu/).

Before starting my PhD, I worked at [Doximity](https://www.doximity.com/), a social network for medical professionals, as a data scientist for a few years. I have a Masters degree in Computer Science from Arizona State University where I worked with [Huan Liu](http://www.public.asu.edu/~huanliu/) on detecting sarcasm. Before that, I completed my Bachelors degree in Computer Science from VIT University, India during which time I worked with [Ponnurangam Kumaraguru](https://www.iiitd.ac.in/pk) at IIIT Delhi on detecting phishing attacks.
